# You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

#   - 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
#   - Thirty days has April, June, September and November.
#     All the rest have thirty-one,
#     Saving February alone, Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine. And on leap years, twenty-nine.
#   - A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

# How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
